# freeCodeCamp Personal Portfolio Page

### View on [CodePen]()

A personal portfolio page built for [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.com)'s Responsive Web Design Certification.

I'm not sure yet if I will end up using this as my own portfolio in the future. I guess it depends on how much I like the end product.
